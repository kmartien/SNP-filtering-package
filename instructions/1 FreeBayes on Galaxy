These are instructions for going from fastq files fresh off a sequencer to BAM files generated by FreeBayes.

1. Upload fastq.gz files to use.galaxy.eu. Make sure they are zipped (.gz), otherwise they'll take forever to upload. Specify the filetype as fastqsanger.gz, not fastq.gz. I think this is because there are several different fastq standards, and the one Illumina uses is fastqsanger.

2. Select all files and click on the gear to the right above the files. Scroll down to "Build Paired Collection" (or something like that).

3. Upload a reference genome for your species.

4. Use bwa-mem2 to align fastqs to a reference genome. See file "bwa-mem settings.png" for parameter settings. The result will be a collection of BAM files, one for each individual.

5. Use FreeBayes to build a vcf from the BAMs. See file "FreeBayes settings.pdf" for parameter settings.

6. Download resulting vcf file and move on to bash/vcftools.filtering.script.txt
